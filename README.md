Web scraping and exploratory data analysis of Hyderabad’s used car market using Python

🚗 **Comparative Analysis of Used Cars in Hyderabad**

Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

📌 **Project Overview**

This project combines web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover actionable insights from Hyderabad’s growing used car market. Real-world data was extracted from CarTrade.com and analyzed to identify patterns in pricing, resale value, demand, and regional variation.

The project demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills — from data extraction to visualization and business interpretation.

🔍 **Problem Statement**

With increasing demand for affordable pre-owned vehicles in Hyderabad, buyers and sellers often lack visibility into how price is influenced by:

Car brand
Vehicle age
Mileage
Fuel type
Location

This gap leads to inconsistent pricing and poor decision-making.

🎯 **Objective**

To scrape used car listings and analyze:

Pricing trends

Resale value patterns

Market behavior across locations and brands

The aim is to enable smarter, data-driven decisions for buyers, sellers, and platforms.

🛠 **Tech Stack**

Python
BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping)
pandas (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
matplotlib & seaborn (Visualization)

⚙️ **Methodology**

Scraped 700+ car listings using BeautifulSoup

Cleaned and structured raw data using pandas

Performed:

Univariate analysis
Bivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis

Created plots to visualize price distributions, brand patterns, depreciation trends, and location-based insights

📈 **Key Insights**

Maruti & Hyundai dominate listings, indicating strong resale trust.

Petrol vehicles are most common, but diesel cars retain better value at high mileage.

3–7 year old vehicles offer best value when balancing depreciation and usability.

Somajiguda & Madhapur command premium prices

LB Nagar & similar areas offer budget-friendly options

Cars without test-drive availability often appear in higher price ranges — indicating market segmentation.

📊 **Impact & Use Cases**

This analysis provides:

✅ Buyers

Identify high-value deals

Avoid overpriced listings

✅ Sellers

Set realistic price expectations

Understand depreciation patterns

✅ Platforms

Improve recommendation logic

Enable market intelligence reporting
